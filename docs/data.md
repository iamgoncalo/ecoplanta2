# Data Provenance & Seed Policy

## Overview

All data in the EcoContainer + Planta Smart Homes platform carries provenance metadata.
This ensures traceability from synthetic development data through to real production integrations.

## Data Source Types

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `synthetic_seeded` | Generated by deterministic seed generator for development/testing |
| `integration_stub` | Returned by adapter stubs when real integration is not yet connected |
| `real` | Live data from connected external systems (Odoo, eGo CRM, Infocasa) |

## Seed Generator

The seed generator produces realistic but synthetic data for all domain entities.
It is controlled by a single `SEED` environment variable.

### Configuration
```env
SEED=42
```

### Determinism Guarantee
- Same `SEED` value always produces identical data
- Uses Python's `random` module with fixed seed + Faker with fixed seed
- Reproducible across runs and environments

### Generated Entities
- **Sales**: Leads, Opportunities, Contracts
- **Fabric**: ProductionLines, WorkOrders, InventoryItems
- **Frameworks**: Frameworks, Materials (high-quality only), Patents
- **Intelligence**: InsightReports, TelemetryEvents
- **Deploy**: Deliveries, DeploymentJobs
- **Partners**: Partners, CapacityPlans
- **Config**: HouseConfigs, BOMs, Suppliers

### Data Constraints
- All materials are high-quality (NO LSF, NO weak materials)
- EU-focused: suppliers and partners from Portugal, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, etc.
- Realistic Portuguese addresses and company names
- Smart materials flagged with `is_smart_material=True`

## Record Schema

Every record includes:
```python
{
    "source": "synthetic_seeded",  # or integration_stub, real
    "source_id": null,             # external system ID if applicable
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Integration Targets

| System | Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Odoo | Factory operations, inventory, production | Stub adapter |
| eGo CRM | Leads, opportunities, contacts | Stub adapter |
| Infocasa | Property listings, market data | Stub adapter |

When real credentials are provided, swap stub adapters for real implementations.
The adapter interface contract remains the same.
